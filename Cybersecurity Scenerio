THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORT
A. Types of Attacks that could be used:
1. Spyware to sniff passwords or credentials.
2. ⁠SQL or Code injection.
3. ⁠Data Breach or Theft.
4. ⁠IAM control.

B. How vulnerability exploited can provide access to network:
1. Session Stealing.
2. Bypassing restrictions or authorization.
3. Unauthorized code execution.

Preventive Measures
1. IAM controls should be limited.
2. The use of Muliti-factor authentication should be adopted.
3. Regular update of applications, VM, Containers.
4. Network Firewalls - Egress and Ingress control.



INCIDNCE RESPONSE PLAN
A. Disabling or Revoking access to all (sensitive data and actions) for all users.
B. Monitoring user activities or history to discover usual activities or events.
C. Updating all instances, VM and application to patch vulnerabilities.
D. Doing a network test to determine traffic flow Incase of data breaches.
E. Reporting network breaches when applicable.
D. Ensure to keep and maintain backups of stored files/data, images.



NETWORK SECURITY MEASURES
1. Ensure all VM, instances and application have the lastest security updates.
2. Test run codes for bugs and vulnerabilities before production.
3. Ensure strict IAM control and disable users who no longer need certain access.
4. Ensure password rotation and two or 3 factor authentication.

Security technologies;
1. Traffic Engress and Ingress Monitoring (Firewall).
2. SSH
3. HTTPS
